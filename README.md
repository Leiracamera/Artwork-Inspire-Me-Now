PROJECT TITLE: Artwork Inspire Me Now

DESCRIPTION: 
Artwork Inspire Me Now is a website where users can go to find an artwork to inspire their day. They can choose from randomly generated artwork or enter keywords to find more specific artists or styles. The artworks are being requested from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API. 
It's a simple idea but as a creative myself I'm already enjoying finding interesting artworks that are way out of my scope of my usual interests, there is something nice about the way that keywords sometime return out of the box results.

I created the website as one of the capstone projects in my Web Development Bootcamp - objectives of the project outlined below. While it is a simple concept at the moment, I do plan to keep adding more unique features and additional search parameters. 

OBJECTIVES: 
- Develop an understanding of how to integrate public APIs into web projects.
- Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
- Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.
- Demonstrate ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.

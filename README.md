PROJECT TITLE: Artwork Inspire Me

DESCRIPTION: 
The Artwork Inspire Me is a website where users can go to find an artwork to inspire their day. They can choose from randomly generated artwork or feed keywords in to find more specific artists or styles. The artworks are being requested from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.

OBJECTIVES: 
- Develop an understanding of how to integrate public APIs into web projects.
- Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
- Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.
- Demonstrate ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.




NOTES TODO: 
- add option when searching by keyword to get more artworks by same keyword, i.e. search again with "blue", or "more artworks..."
- check the error paths for search artworks
- Add CSS for entire site
